# Football Project : Frontend


### Overview
**This is the frontend of the Football Project, a ReactJS-based web application.
It provides a streamlined interface for creating and managing football matches, tracking live scores and league tables,
and interacting with a powerful backend and MySQL database for real-time data management and synchronization.**

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (version 14 or later)
- npm (version 6 or later)

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- **npm start**: Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
  
- **npm run build**: Builds the app for production to the build folder.
   It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
  
- **npm test**: Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
   See the section about [running tests](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/running-tests) for more information.
  
- **npm run eject**: Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!
   If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time.
   This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
   Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them.
   All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.
   You don't have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature.
   However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Features

- **SPA (Single Page Application)**: Built as a single-page application for fast, fluid navigation without full page reloads.
  
- **User Registration and Authentication**:
   - User Sign-Up: Seamlessly register to create an account and start managing your football activities.
   - Secure Login: Authenticate with secure login credentials to access personalized features and data.
     
- **Game Management Dashboard**:
   - Create and Manage Games: Users can create new football matches from various leagues and manage existing ones, provided that both teams are not currently live.
   - Match Score Control: Easily update and control the scores of your games in real-time.

  - Dynamic League Tables: View automatically updating league tables that reflect real-time match results.
    
- **Axios-Powered API Integration**:
  - Backend Communication: Axios is used to handle all HTTP requests between the frontend and the backend, enabling efficient data retrieval and submission.
  - Database Interaction: Seamlessly interact with the backend database to store and retrieve game data, user profiles, and match scores.
  - Interceptors for Secure API Calls: Axios interceptors manage authentication tokens and error handling for secure and reliable API communication.
    
- **Popular React Hooks**: Leverage React's popular hooks like useState, useEffect, useCallback, useReducer, and more
  for efficient state management, side effect handling, memoization, and complex state logic across the application
  
- **JS Cookies for Session Management**:
   - Session Persistence: JS Cookies are used to manage session tokens, ensuring that user sessions remain active and secure across the application.
   - Easy Authentication: Simplify user authentication processes with cookies, maintaining session state effectively.
     
- **Developer Tools and Best Practices**:
  - Comprehensive Testing: Robust component testing using React Testing Library to ensure reliability and maintainability.
  - Code Quality: ESLint is configured to enforce coding standards and maintain high code quality throughout the project.
  - Optimized Build Processes: Scripts for building, testing, and deploying the app are streamlined for efficient development and deployment.
